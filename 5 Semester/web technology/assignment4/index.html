        <p>Title: Synthesis & Evaluation</p>
        <p>Date of the evaluation: 28/01/2020</p>
        <p>Group number: 80</p>
        <p>Author names: Alvin Milaqi, David Baumgartner</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We think the website in general is easily navigable as it is simple and not very rich in diverse content. While the sections are in an optimal order, changing their order will not render them incomprehensible as they are all mostly independent of each
            other. We have also used some colors in certain areas to make content even more easily viewable. Some people with disabilities may also able to easily navigate our website via keyboard, eye-tracking or speech navigation without encountering
            any issues.

        <h1>Accessability highlights</h1>
        <p>
            We think some of the most relevant guidelines are 1.4.1 because we made sure to use color to make content more distinguishable and 2.4.3 because no matter what order the webpage sections are viewed in, their meaning does not change.
